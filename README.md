# 💻 CODSOFT - Python Programming 🐍

The repository contains three Python-based mini projects developed during my Python programming internship. The Calculator is a command-line tool that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The Password Generator creates secure, random passwords based on user-defined preferences, including length and character types. The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is an interactive CLI-based game where users compete against the computer, with randomized choices determining the outcome based on traditional game rules.




## 🚀 Features

- Calculator: Basic arithmetic operations, history tracking, scientific functions.

- Password Generator: Adjustable length, special characters, and word-based password generation.

- Rock-Paper-Scissors: Single-player mode vs. AI, score tracking, high difficulty.




## 🦾 Technologies used

 - 👨‍💻 Programming Languages: Python 3.x

- Libraries: random (for generating passwords and game choices).

sys (for handling command-line interactions).
